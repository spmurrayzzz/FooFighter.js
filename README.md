# FooFighter.js

An experiment in making a really crappy starfighter game.

[Demo](http://spmurrayzzz.com/dropbox/foofighter/)

## How to play

While the gameplay itself is still under development, it can be said that the game is about
survival and efficiency. You have 5 minutes to amass the best score you can without perishing.

Use the cursor keys to move your player and space bar to fire lasers. Each laser you fire deducts
2 points from your total score (won't go below 0 points). Each enemy unit behaves differently and are
worth different point values:

- Asteroid (5 and 10 pts): slow, deliberate movement on the X and Y axis. Large asteroids explode into smaller asteroids
on collisions.
- Enemy Ship (15 points): Moves along the Y-axis and fires lasers .
- Enemy UFO (18 points): Kamikaze unit that accelerates towards the player along X and Y axis.
